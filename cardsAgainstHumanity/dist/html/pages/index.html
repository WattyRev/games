            <h1>What is Cards Against Humanity?</h1>

            <p>Cards Against Humanity is a party game for horrible people. Unlike most of the party games you've played before, Cards Against Humanity is as despicable and awkward as you and your friends.</p>

            <p>The game is simple. Each round, one player asks a question from a black card, and everyone else answers with their funniest white card. Click the button below to start a new game!</p>
